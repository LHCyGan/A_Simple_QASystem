    "#### 检索式的问答系统\n",
    "问答系统所需要的数据已经提供，对于每一个问题都可以找得到相应的答案，所以可以理解为每一个样本数据是 ``<问题、答案>``。 那系统的核心是当用户输入一个问题的时候，首先要找到跟这个问题最相近的已经存储在库里的问题，然后直接返回相应的答案即可（但实际上也可以抽取其中的实体或者关键词)。 举一个简单的例子：\n",
    "\n",
    "假设我们的库里面已有存在以下几个<问题,答案>：\n",
    "- <\"阿里巴巴主要做什么方面的业务？”， “他们主要做电商方面”>\n",
    "- <\"人工智能和机器学习的关系什么？\", \"其实机器学习是人工智能的一个范畴，很多人工智能的应用要基于机器学习的技术\">\n",
    "- <\"人工智能最核心的语言是什么？\"， ”Python“>\n",
    "- .....\n",
    "\n",
    "假设一个用户往系统中输入了问题 “alibaba是做什么的？”， 那这时候系统先去匹配最相近的“已经存在库里的”问题。 那在这里很显然是 “alibaba是做什么的”和“alibaba主要做什么方面的业务？”是最相近的。 所以当我们定位到这个问题之后，直接返回它的答案 “他们主要做人工智能方面的教育”就可以了。 所以这里的核心问题可以归结为计算两个问句（query）之间的相似度。"

    "#### 项目中涉及到的任务描述\n",
    "问答系统看似简单，但其中涉及到的内容比较多。 在这里先做一个简单的解释，总体来讲，我们即将要搭建的模块包括：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 文本的读取： 需要从相应的文件里读取```(问题，答案)```\n",
    "- 文本预处理： 清洗文本很重要，需要涉及到```停用词过滤```等工作\n",
    "- 文本的表示： 如果表示一个句子是非常核心的问题，这里会涉及到```tf-idf```, ```Glove```以及```BERT Embedding```\n",
    "- 文本相似度匹配： 在基于检索式系统中一个核心的部分是计算文本之间的```相似度```，从而选择相似度最高的问题然后返回这些问题的答案\n",
    "- 倒排表： 为了加速搜索速度，我们需要设计```倒排表```来存储每一个词与出现的文本\n",
    "- 词义匹配：直接使用倒排表会忽略到一些意思上相近但不完全一样的单词，我们需要做这部分的处理。我们需要提前构建好```相似的单词```然后搜索阶段使用\n",
    "- 拼写纠错：我们不能保证用户输入的准确，所以第一步需要做用户输入检查，如果发现用户拼错了，我们需要及时在后台改正，然后按照修改后的在库里面搜索\n",
    "- 文档的排序： 最后返回结果的排序根据文档之间```余弦相似度```有关，同时也跟倒排表中匹配的单词有关\n"

    "#### 项目中需要的数据：\n",
    "1. ```train-v2.0.json```: 这个数据包含了问题和答案的pair， 但是以JSON格式存在，需要编写parser来提取出里面的问题和答案。 \n",
    "2. ```glove.6B```: 这个文件需要从网上下载，下载地址为：https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/， 请使用d=200的词向量\n",
    "3. ```spell-errors.txt``` 这个文件主要用来编写拼写纠错模块。 文件中第一列为正确的单词，之后列出来的单词都是常见的错误写法。 但这里需要注意的一点是我们没有给出他们之间的概率，也就是p(错误|正确），所以我们可以认为每一种类型的错误都是```同等概率```\n",
    "4. ```vocab.txt``` 这里列了几万个英文常见的单词，可以用这个词库来验证是否有些单词被拼错\n",
    "5. ```testdata.txt``` 这里搜集了一些测试数据，可以用来测试自己的spell corrector。这个文件只是用来测试自己的程序。"

    "此部分需要做文本方面的处理。 以下是可以用到的一些方法：\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. 停用词过滤 （去网上搜一下 \"english stop words list\"，会出现很多包含停用词库的网页，或者直接使用NLTK自带的）   \n",
    "- 2. 转换成lower_case： 这是一个基本的操作   \n",
    "- 3. 去掉一些无用的符号： 比如连续的感叹号！！！， 或者一些奇怪的单词。\n",
    "- 4. 去掉出现频率很低的词：比如出现次数少于10,20.... （想一下如何选择阈值）\n",
    "- 5. 对于数字的处理： 分词完只有有些单词可能就是数字比如44，415，把所有这些数字都看成是一个单词，这个新的单词我们可以定义为 \"#number\"\n",
    "- 6. lemmazation： 在这里不要使用stemming， 因为stemming的结果有可能不是valid word。\n"

    "### 4. 拼写纠错\n",
    "其实用户在输入问题的时候，不能期待他一定会输入正确，有可能输入的单词的拼写错误的。这个时候我们需要后台及时捕获拼写错误，并进行纠正，然后再通过修正之后的结果再跟库里的问题做匹配。这里我们需要实现一个简单的拼写纠错的代码，然后自动去修复错误的单词。\n",
    "\n",
    "这里使用的拼写纠错方法，就是使用noisy channel model。 我们回想一下它的表示：\n",
    "\n",
    "$c^* = \\text{argmax}_{c\\in candidates} ~~p(c|s) = \\text{argmax}_{c\\in candidates} ~~p(s|c)p(c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "这里的```candidates```指的是针对于错误的单词的候选集，这部分我们可以假定是通过edit_distance来获取的（比如生成跟当前的词距离为1/2的所有的valid 单词。 valid单词可以定义为存在词典里的单词。 ```c```代表的是正确的单词， ```s```代表的是用户错误拼写的单词。 所以我们的目的是要寻找出在``candidates``里让上述概率最大的正确写法``c``。 \n",
    "\n",
    "$p(s|c)$，这个概率我们可以通过历史数据来获得，也就是对于一个正确的单词$c$, 有百分之多少人把它写成了错误的形式1，形式2...  这部分的数据可以从``spell_errors.txt``里面找得到。但在这个文件里，我们并没有标记这个概率，所以可以使用uniform probability来表示。这个也叫做channel probability。\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(c)$，这一项代表的是语言模型，也就是假如我们把错误的$s$，改造成了$c$， 把它加入到当前的语句之后有多通顺？在本次项目里我们使用bigram来评估这个概率。 举个例子： 假如有两个候选 $c_1, c_2$， 然后我们希望分别计算出这个语言模型的概率。 由于我们使用的是``bigram``， 我们需要计算出两个概率，分别是当前词前面和后面词的``bigram``概率。 用一个例子来表示：\n",
    "\n",
    "给定： ``We are go to school tomorrow``， 对于这句话我们希望把中间的``go``替换成正确的形式，假如候选集里有个，分别是``going``, ``went``, 这时候我们分别对这俩计算如下的概率：\n",
    "$p(going|are)p(to|going)$和 $p(went|are)p(to|went)$， 然后把这个概率当做是$p(c)$的概率。 然后再跟``channel probability``结合给出最终的概率大小。\n",
    "\n",
    "那这里的$p(are|going)$这些bigram概率又如何计算呢？答案是训练一个语言模型！ 但训练一个语言模型需要一些文本数据，这个数据怎么找？ 在这次项目里我们会用到``nltk``自带的``reuters``的文本类数据来训练一个语言模型。当然，如果你有资源你也可以尝试其他更大的数据。最终目的就是计算出``bigram``概率。 "

    "在本次项目中我们实现了一个简易的问答系统。基于这个项目，我们其实可以有很多方面的延伸。\n",
    "- 在这里，我们使用文本向量之间的余弦相似度作为了一个标准。但实际上，我们也可以基于基于包含关键词的情况来给一定的权重。比如一个单词跟related word有多相似，越相似就意味着相似度更高，权重也会更大。 \n",
    "- 另外 ，除了根据词向量去寻找``related words``也可以提前定义好同义词库，但这个需要大量的人力成本。 \n",
    "- 在这里，我们直接返回了问题的答案。 但在理想情况下，我们还是希望通过问题的种类来返回最合适的答案。 比如一个用户问：“明天北京的天气是多少？”， 那这个问题的答案其实是一个具体的温度（其实也叫做实体），所以需要在答案的基础上做进一步的抽取。这项技术其实是跟信息抽取相关的。 \n",
    "- 对于词向量，我们只是使用了``average pooling``， 除了average pooling，我们也还有其他的经典的方法直接去学出一个句子的向量。\n",
    "- 短文的相似度分析一直是业界和学术界一个具有挑战性的问题。在这里我们使用尽可能多的同义词来提升系统的性能。但除了这种简单的方法，可以尝试其他的方法比如WMD，或者适当结合parsing相关的知识点。 "
